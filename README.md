Installation:

Ensure you have python installed (v3.9)

Install required modules (web3, gunicorn, pandas, flask):
  pip install web3 gunicorn pandas flask
    OR
  pip3 install web3 gunicorn pandas flask
  
modify the app.conf file to include your orchestrator information and participating orchestrators you wish to query. I intend to update the app.conf file in this repo to include all of the participating orchestrators as more join the cause.
